## Common Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️

### 1. Spending All Your Money at Once
**Problem:** You buy everything with your 10 Cogs, then a better opportunity appears

**Solution:** Keep some cash in reserve for new opportunities

### 2. Panic Selling
**Problem:** Stock drops 2% and you sell immediately, missing the recovery

**Solution:** Markets fluctuate! Hold through small dips unless you have a reason to sell

### 3. Ignoring Activity
**Problem:** Buying a stock when the team is inactive

**Solution:** Check team activity in Discord - active teams = rising prices

### 4. Not Setting Alerts
**Problem:** Missing the perfect sell price while you're asleep

**Solution:** Use `/alert` to get DM'd when stocks hit your target price

### 5. Forgetting to Check Charts
**Problem:** Buying at a peak without seeing the trend

**Solution:** Always check `/graph` or `/candlestick` before big trades
